```

### Text

Hi HN!

I built an MCP server that lets AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) generate professional Mermaid diagrams from natural language descriptions.

NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narasimhaponnada/mermaid-mcp-server
GitHub: https://github.com/Narasimhaponnada/mermaid-mcp

**What it does:**
You: "Create a microservices architecture diagram"
AI: *Generates professional SVG diagram*

**Features:**
- 22+ diagram types (flowcharts, sequences, ERDs, state machines, etc.)
- 50+ pre-built templates
- Works with GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor
- Production-ready SVG/PNG/PDF exports
- Zero-config setup: `npm install -g @narasimhaponnada/mermaid-mcp-server`

**Use cases:**
- Auto-generate diagrams in PRs
- Keep architecture docs in sync
- Speed up onboarding
- Technical proposals

**Tech stack:**
- TypeScript + MCP SDK
- Puppeteer for browser-based rendering
- Fixes for XML-compliance (proper `<br/>` tags, etc.)

**Try it:**
```bash
npm install -g @narasimhaponnada/mermaid-mcp-server
mermaid-mcp --version
```

Then configure in VS Code settings (one line) and ask Copilot to generate diagrams.

Built this because I was tired of manually updating architecture diagrams. Feedback and contributions welcome!
